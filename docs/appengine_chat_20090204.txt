-quota increase for loading scenario
    -jeverling said something about remote_api, coming up in the next
    few days. also coming in the next release: revamped bulk upload
    tool: it will generally have a better way to manage the upload options and
    flow, better recovery

-need a function to delete all data for an app
    -not gonna happen any time soon

-is datastore.Entity a private API?
    -no, it's safe to use

-getting error "can't update the same entity twice in a transaction or operation". advice for fixing?
