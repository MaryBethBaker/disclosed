Hello, 

First of all, thank you for the great show. You are a jewel in the
Nile of Canadian broadcast programming. I am happy to learn you are
not getting shut down after all. 

I have recently created www.disclosed.ca -- a free search engine of
historical government contracts, taking advantage of our
government's Proactive Disclosure policy.

I've identified three types of users for the site: Canadians curious
about government spending, media correspondents doing research, 
and companies doing competitive research before bidding on a gov't
contract.

The site is currently in its infancy. Lots of features remain to be
added.

I would be willing to talk more about the site if you are
interested.
