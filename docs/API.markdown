# Disclosed.ca REST API Proposal

This document proposes a simple RESTful HTTP based API that exposes existing
disclosed.ca data in to easy to use, mashable representations.

## Notation

This API should operate at some base URL, such as `/api` or `/data`.

Variables in URI paths are denoted with a leading `:` such as `/vendors/:vid/`.  These denote this part of the path is a variable, to be replaced by the proper identifier for that resource.

## Representations

Every resource and collection should have these representations:

### `text/html`

### `text/plain`

### `application/json`

## Resources

## Collections

## Collection Options
